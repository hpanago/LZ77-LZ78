We work in a strange industry. There is a much higher need for developers than can be satisfied by new developers coming into the field.

 This is a problem that has existed for years, and it is getting worse as time goes on.We have a serious shortage of talent to meet the demand, but our industry is really quite young . Most software projects fail. Nearly all of them come in over budget. The best guidance we have on this subject from thought leaders boils down to “These are some common ways we solve these problems, but our solutions frequently don’t work, so the only thing you can really do is try it out and see if it works for you”.The reality we live in is that “Senior Developer” means a person who has been slinging code for more than 3 years. These people are put into leadership positions, and typically things play out as you would expect — quite badly.
